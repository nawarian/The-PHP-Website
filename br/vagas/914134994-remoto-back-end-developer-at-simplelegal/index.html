    <h1>[Remoto] Back-end Developer @ SimpleLegal</h1>

<p><strong>Este trabalho requer inglês, salário muito competitivo</strong></p>

<p>Precisamos Back-end Developer (Python, SQL)</p>

<h2>Nossa empresa</h2>

<p>SimpleLegal is a legal tech startup, headquartered in Mountain View, that is innovating the way corporate legal teams work. Used by the legal departments at Reddit, Alphabet, GitHub, and over 250 more, we are quickly becoming the SaaS platform of choice for enterprise legal teams. Sales has Salesforce, Legal has SimpleLegal.</p>

<p>Our culture focuses on ownership, transparency, and community. Development is light on process and every developer makes an impact, usually merging code within their first week. We have dedicated frontend engineers, so backend engineers occasionally dip into full-stack, but primarily focus on the backend.</p>

<p>The engineering team watches and discusses tech talks over lunch once a week. Every other week we dedicate a full day to “Fix-It Friday” for self-assigned work: experiment with a library; build an internal tool; improve the company for yourself and your coworkers as you see fit. We also have a liberal open-source policy for personal projects, and have released a few packages of our own, as well: https://github.com/simplelegal</p>
