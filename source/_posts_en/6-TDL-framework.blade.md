    Learning a new (programming) language is an extremely necessary
    skill for any fullstack engineer. Being a fullstack myself,
    as most PHP programmers are, I came up with my own framework
    to make it rational.

## TL;DR

If you could take one thing away from this text, take this:
**Test-Driven Development can be used for learning too.**
[Learn how to TDD efficiently](/en/issue/real-life-tdd-php/) and you'll
grasp the main concept of this whole text.

TDL = Test-Driven Learning.

Recently I started (again) the most exciting quest every
programmer has to go through: **learning a new programming language.**

This time I've decided to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/),
which is (still) crazy interesting to me, as I'm mostly a web developer
and never touched anything systems related besides the php source code.

After doing this whole process multiple times, one starts to see
patterns on this learning process. It envolves a good mix of
self-awareness with project management skills (yes) to get there.

I believe this time, learning Rust, I came to a more or less stable
version of my learning framework based on TDL. **I don't intend to
state this is the ultimate way of learning a new programming
language or something like this.** This you'll have to figure out
by yourself.

I'd like, though, to show in which direction my learning process
headed and how its latest version looks like, now that I'm
learning Rust.

As usual, let's switch on the "no bs mode" and get started!

Each section here will get a topics list so you can know the main
thoughts in beforehand. Feel free to jump to the next heading if the
bullet points here don't catch your attention.

## Getting started with a new programming language

Topics in this section:

- All programming languages are similar
- Find the language's purpose
- 

**Most programming languages are very similar to each other.** They
might have different structures, syntax, conventions but in the end
of the day most of them will present you with a stack-based
execution where you store variables, load values into them, execute
expressions, call functions and so on.

Usually **one language differs itelf from another by having a purpose.**

PHP is was a language developed to make CGI easier, JavaScript was
born to make web pages interactive, ActionScript to make flash programs
interactive and extensible, C for zero-cost abstraction on systems
development, Rust for memory safety while as fast as other system languages,
LLVM's IR to make easier to create new programming languages.

**Knowing a language's purpose helps you reason how it works.**
